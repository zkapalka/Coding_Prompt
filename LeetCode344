//Solution:

class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {

    //Set up the pointers as int since the index are ints 
    //start of array
    int l = 0;

    //end of array
    int r = s.length - 1;

// While l is less than r, the loop will continue
    while (l < r) {

      //create a temp variable to store the first char
      char temp = s[l];

      //increment l and store the last character
      s[l++] = s[r];

      //decrease r and store temp
      s[r--] = temp;

      //loop and flip the chars until loop exits
    }
        
    }
}
