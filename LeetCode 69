//SOLUTION:
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        // to guard against any negative numbers, we can also update it to protect against 1 as well
        if (x < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot compute the square root of a negative number.");
        }
        //use the built-in method to get square root
        double result = Math.sqrt(x);

        //We use the math floor built in method to specifically round down, and we have to be explicit with the type-casting otherwise, it will return an error about loosey conversion
        int roundedDownResult = (int) Math.floor(result);
        return roundedDownResult;
        
    }
}
