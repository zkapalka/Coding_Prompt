//SOLUTION

class Solution {
  public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
// init the pointer to keep track of position where the next non-val element is
    int i = 0;

//use a for loop to go thru the array
    for (final int num : nums)
//If item in array is NOT the same as the value to be removed, this is assigned to the new array and incrementing
      if (num != val)
        nums[i++] = num;

//Return the new length
    return i;
  }
}
