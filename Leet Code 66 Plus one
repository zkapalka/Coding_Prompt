//SOLUTION

class Solution {
  public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {

//Start from the end of the array from right to left. 
    for (int i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
//Check to make sure that all digits are less than 9
      if (digits[i] < 9) {
//Increase the last index by one
        ++digits[i];
        return digits;
      }

//If the current digit is 9, set the index to 0 and then continue the loop because 9 + 1 = 10 so there is a carry over
      digits[i] = 0;
    }

//This create a new array by making an additional index to account for carryover
    int[] ans = new int[digits.length + 1];
//Set the first index to 1 so if the array is 9, 99, or 999, it will become 10, 100, or 1000 and so on.
    ans[0] = 1;
    return ans;
  }
