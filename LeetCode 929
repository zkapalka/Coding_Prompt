//Solution: 

class Solution {
  public int numUniqueEmails(String[] emails) {

// Set up a new variable using Set, set is used because Set only allows for unique values, it doesn't accept any duplicate values
    Set<String> normalized = new HashSet<>();

// Start the for loop
    for (final String email : emails) {

// The email is broken in two separate parts using @ as the delimiter, and the domain is put into 1 index and the local is put in 0 index
      String[] parts = email.split("@");

// Use a new variable called local to hold the string and using delimiter + to remove all characters after + if there are any
      String[] local = parts[0].split("\\+");

// Use built in method to add local index 0 and replace any periods in the index with no character if there is any period, and then add the @ and the domain that was rmoved in the first line of the for loop
      normalized.add(local[0].replace(".", "") + "@" + parts[1]);
    }

    return normalized.size();
  }
